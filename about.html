				</h2>
				<p>The Computer Science department of PESIT in association with
					the PES Open Source Community, Bangalore is very excited to
					announce Ayana, a two day technical workshop + hackathon to be held
					on the 28th and 29th of April, 2012 in Bangalore, India. This event
					will mark the initiation of Ayana in the history of PESIT. This
					event is conducted in association with the PES Open Source

					the campus and hack their way to glory in 24 hours. Its fun,
					exciting and stimulating. We hereby issue a call to action for
					students, developers and designers from all across India to come to
					PESIT, Bangalore and participate in this most awesome of events!
					Put on your programming shoes, grab that coffee mug and brace
					yourself for an exciting round of coding madness.</p>

				<p>We will provide you with everything you need to have fun, be
					creative and productive, and impress your peers with what you can
					do with a computer and the wealth of technologies and data
					available on the Web. Bogged down and clueless on what a ‘hack’ is
					or what you can develop? We have it sorted for you! We will be
					fueling your creativity with a variety of open source technologies
					and APIs, right from Android, Qt, Ruby to even kernel programming.
					We will keep you fed, watered and entertained for the duration of
					the event. All you need to bring is your creativity, your laptop,
					and your toothbrush</p>

					<a id="fragment" name="Hackathon"> What is a Hackathon? </a>
				</h2>
				<p>
					Many of you would have attended hackathons conducted by big wigs
					like Yahoo or Microsoft. But, what is hacking? For newbies to
					hacking here is a great introduction on Hacking 101 by Chris
					Heilmann or check out Ricky Montalvo's Hackumentary. The aim of
					this event is to promote hacker culture. A hacker is different from
					a network penetrator. To know the difference, read this <a
